## Purpose
In a world where we have more data every single day it is vital to have it clean and ready to be used. When we have different sources of information it is almost a fact that it may be presented in different formats, so we have to fix that in order to be able to read it. In addition, when large amounts of data it is impossible to fix it "manually" so we have to use powerful tools that can help us with that and allow us to do a better, cleaner, and more exact analysis.
